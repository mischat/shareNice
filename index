    <h2>Welcome to shareNice</h2> 

    <p>Our goal is to provide an ethical social sharing widget. We want your users to be able to share your web pages with their friends through social networking sites without having to give any information away to money-making third parties. sharenice is written and maintained by <a href="http://mmt.me.uk/foaf.rdf#mischa">Mischa Tuffield</a>. An example of the shareNice button in action can be found on the top right hand corner of this page, and on <a href="http://mmt.me.uk/">http://mmt.me.uk/</a>, <a href="http://www.garlik.com/">www.garlik.com</a>, and <a href="http://data.southampton.ac.uk/">data.southampton.ac.uk</a>.</p>

    <p>There are two ways you can make use of shareNice, you can choose to use the version <a href="/code.js">we host</a>, or you can host your own version of the tool by cloning the <a href="http://github.com/mischat/shareNice">shareNice code on github</a>. In order to provide the most uninstrusive and ethical webpage sharing tool we could, we have taken a number of steps to preserve our users' privacy - see our <a href="/website/privacy">privacy policy</a> and our <a href="/website/technical">technical information page</a>.</p>

    <p>Please submit any issues you may to <a href="https://github.com/mischat/sharenice/issues">shareNice's issue tracker on github</a>.</p>

    <h3>Todo List</h3> 
   
    <ul>
     <li>Allow for multiple shareNice buttons on one page (priority low)</li>
     <li>Write a Wordpress plugin for use on blogs</li>
     <li>Turn shareNice into a class (Seb)</li>
     <li>Make the share with twitter have a configurable #hashtag (ChrisG)</li>

     <li>Make the buttom work more naturally on the right-hand side of a page. For some stuff ChrisG has done where he  worked out where in the page the mouse is (left or right hand half). eg. http://data.dev8d.org/2011/programme/tool.php?src=http://data.dev8d.org/2011/programme/dev8d_programme.rdf&date=2011-02-16&desc=hover (feel free to steal code under license of your choice) (ChrisG)</li>
    </ul>

   <h3>Done List</h3>
    <ul>
     <li><del>Make use of <a href="https://code.google.com/speed/articles/compressing-javascript.html">Google JavaScript shortening tool</a> for less bytes :)</del></a>
     <li><del>Add more social sharing sites</del> ... more avaiable on request</li>
     <li><del>Make it configurable perhaps using a metatag</del> this is achieved using html elements</li>
     <li><del>Make the "+ share" label configurable</del> configurable using 'share-label' element</li>
     <li><del>The images should have title="Live Journal" etc. to make the hover prettier (ChrisG)</del></li>
     <li><del>"Share" isn't very distinct. I would be tempted to have twitter & facebook icons and a "more" button, that way people scan the page and spot the icons then see more and can find LJ or whatever. (ChrisG)</del></li>
     <li><del>Get page title and URL (maybe as an option?) If using "title" could only show string of $1 in /^(.*?)( - |::| \| |$)/ (ChrisG)</dev></li>
    </ul>
